# Handsfree-KGS
Play Go on KGS handsfree using the webcam

This projects aims to fulfill one of my dreams, playing GO on a pyhsical board against online opponents. I know I want this because I actually did play GO on a board that I owned in the past against KGS opponents. It was tedious but still worth it as playing on a pyhsical board is an amazing feeling.

With this project, after a game begins on KGS, I will play my move and the computer's webcam will figure out what move I played which will then automaticall place my stone by manipulating the mouse and click at the exact spot I played.

There maybe an another component added to this project in the future, a physical arm, that will take inputs from the computer and actually play my opponents moves on the board :))
